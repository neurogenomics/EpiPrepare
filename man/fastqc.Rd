\arguments{
\item{files}{Paths to files of the type specified in \code{format}.}

\item{rootdir}{Base directory containing all files for the project.}

\item{outdir}{Create all output files in the specified output directory.
Please note that this directory must exist as the program
will not create it.  If this option is not set then the
output file for each sequence file is created in the same
directory as the sequence file which was processed.}

\item{dir}{Selects a directory to be used for temporary files written when
generating report images. Defaults to system temp directory if
not specified.}

\item{format}{Bypasses the normal sequence file format detection and
forces the program to use the specified format.  Valid
formats are bam,sam,bam_mapped,sam_mapped and fastq.}

\item{threads}{Specifies the number of files which can be processed
simultaneously.  Each thread will be allocated 250MB of
memory so you shouldn't run more threads than your
available memory will cope with, and not more than
6 threads on a 32 bit machine.}

\item{fastqc_x}{Path to \code{fastqc} software executable.}

\item{...}{Additional string arguments to be passed to \code{fastqc}.}
}
